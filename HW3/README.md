### Tasks

- Generated word2vec features for Amazon reviews dataset and compared with Google's pretrained word2vec model. 
- Compared the classifiers performances and also the impact of features (TF-IDF vs word2vec)
- Using the pretrained word2vec features, trained simple classifiers like a perceptron and SVM; Feedforward Multilayer Perceptron networks with features being fed either as an average or concatenation; Simple RNN, GRU and LSTM to predict rating value for a review. 

### Observation

The trained word2vec is not able to capture relationships as well as the pretrained word2vec but does capture similarities of words pertinent to the task better. 

### Notes

All experiments are shown in PDF/.ipynb.
